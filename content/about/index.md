Hi, Iâ€™m Krishna. Considering how much of a narcissistic person I am, it feels kinda difficult to write this about section. 

Let me give it a try. 

I do *something* at Zerodha. More than a year back, my life completely changed when I got the chance to meet Nithin and join my dream workplace. To be honest, it wasnâ€™t even a dreamâ€”I didnâ€™t think I was good enough for [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com/). But, maybe I fooled them. Jokes aside, I think Iâ€™m one of the luckiest people to work here considering how useless I am ðŸ˜‡

I started working in startups during my first year of college. My college didnâ€™t have attendance issues, and since it was COVID, I didnâ€™t really have to go. I spent all of my college life working in different startups, exploring, building a few things, and just figuring stuff out. While people around me were studying hard for their CAs or other reputed courses, I was busy [tweeting](https://x.com/krishnalohiaaa) random things.
Apart from all this, I traveled, read, and got into calisthenics. Iâ€™m one of those people who talks about maximizing protein in every meal because, sadly, Iâ€™m a vegetarian ðŸ¥¬

The thing I spend a lot of time doing is reading and learning new things. This little space on the internet is where I want write about the things Iâ€™ve learned and found fascinating. Itâ€™s also an attempt to improve my writing and become more articulate.
Oh, btw, I also love watching movies. Big time! Ok, time to watch *The Godfather* again.
