In and in between each word lies an entire universe. Words have this wonderful ability to transport you to places that you not only wouldn't have traveled but wouldn't have imagined as well.

Words have been a gift and blessing to me. They've helped me go down weird rabbit holes, learn wonderful things, and also meet amazing people. Words are portable magic â€“ they not only reshape your inner universe but also remake you from the outside by bringing you closer to people that you otherwise wouldn't have met.

I hope words do to you, in this little corner of the internet, what they did to me.

With love,
Bhuvan
