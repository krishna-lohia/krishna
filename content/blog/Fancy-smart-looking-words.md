So I host a show called [Who said what?](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuJA1JMOOYDx5DbI32aWoAz65VgH5HWV0) We started this because I saw some tweet from a founder saying he will open 1200 showrooms in 19 days or some shit like this. And I told my manager what the hell is he even saying. So he said this make for a nice show and that’s the story behind starting this show (although nobody asked but okay)

In the [latest one](https://thedailybrief.zerodha.com/p/who-said-what-about-overvalued-markets?r=45bycr&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=false) I learned about various interesting things.

The first one was about something called as inference scaling. I am total idiot when it comes to technology I dont understand jack shit, if you told me to explain how internet works I wouldnt know. If you asked me what LLMs are, I will shit my pants. But inference scaling seems slightly easier to explain. All of us use ChatGPT or any AI in some form or the other. So right now what happens is that you ask GPT something and it takes some amount of time to compute(or think) and then give you an output. Now, a lot of these AI experts are claiming that the focus should shift to inference scaling i.e. a lot of focus, time should be spent on making sur ethe AI takes more time to think and in doing this it will give you a much more better output in terms of research, nuance and being more articulate. 

AI experts are saying this because they have hit some walls with scaling their next gen models and thus instead of making their AI models bigger the focus is on how AI models optimise existing knowledge.

Ethan Mollick, professor at Wharton, tweeted this about the term inference scaling [here](https://x.com/emollick/status/1880123595361522069).

The other thing I learned was the term called polycrisis, a term popularised by Adam Tooze.  That’s when multiple crisis or multiple lifechanging events take place at the same time together. One such polycrisis that Ezra Klein, columnist at NYT, highlights is [Donald trump coming in, global warming, rise of AI and falling fertility rates](https://x.com/ezraklein/status/1878845296140263760) 

But, I prefer to think that these [polycrisis](https://polycrisis.org/resource/chartbook/) or lifechanging events keep happening all the time. I mean Ezra puts this states into a full doomporn thing. But the thing is the world keeps changing all the time, if weird things dont happen how will we evolve?
Historian Niall Ferguson said the polycrisis is “just history happening.”

One last thing, I had heard this term [CAPE ratio](https://capeindia.iima.ac.in/) a bunch of times in passing but never really cared about it. This time, I actually got around to read very little on it so my understanding is preliminary. Like how a PE ratio looks at the price of the company against the companies earnings, the higher it is its a sign of the company being overvalued (in loose terms)

CAPE ratio is that but it smooths out the earnings over 10 years and adjusts this for inflation. It’s a better metric to look at because the time frame is longer, it gives a better picture of the market.

So that’s what I learned this week. Random? Absolutely. Useful? Very unlikely.
