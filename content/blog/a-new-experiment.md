I had 0 clue what an earnings call or an analyst call even was—or really, anything remotely related to the markets. And this was while I was working at [Zerodha](https://zerodha.com/).

Things changed when we started [Markets by Zerodha](https://www.youtube.com/@marketsbyzerodha/videos) 10 months back. That’s when my learning really took off. Honestly, everything that comes out of that channel is driven by a very selfish reason: to learn more. And it’s not just me—it’s true for all 5-6 of us who work on it. 

Over time, we’ve started bunch of new shows, tried various different experiments. And the most recent one, which I’m really excited about, is something called [The Chatter](https://thechatterbyzerodha.substack.com/).

The idea behind The Chatter is simple: we go through earnings calls, transcripts, and interviews with company management—whether it’s a large-cap giant or a tiny small-cap. Then we pick out the most interesting, insightful bits. The stuff that actually makes you think.

Earnings call by the way is a conference call hosted by a listed company right after they release their financial results. It’s from calls like these that you get those viral headlines—like the recent one about how Zomato’s food delivery growth is slowing because of quick commerce.

In some ways, I’ve already been doing this with [Who Said What](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuJA1JMOOYDx5DbI32aWoAz65VgH5HWV0&si=QoXCjH8tCNrbqY43), the show I host. But The Chatter is just another selfish way for me to stretch my own learning even further.

Hope you enjoy it—[check it out here](https://thechatterbyzerodha.substack.com/).
